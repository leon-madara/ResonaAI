# General Coding Rules for ResonaAI

## Project Context
ResonaAI is a mental health support platform with voice-based AI therapy assistance. This is a sensitive healthcare application requiring strict attention to security, privacy, and reliability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- Comment all public functions with purpose, inputs, outputs
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use TypeScript for frontend, Python with type hints for backend

### 2. Security-First
- Never log sensitive user data (PII, health information)
- Always validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

### 3. Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling at all layers
- Use consistent error response formats
- Log errors with appropriate detail for debugging
- Never expose internal errors to users

### 4. Performance
- API responses should be <200ms (95th percentile)
- Database queries should be <50ms (95th percentile)
- Optimize resource usage and efficiency
- Use appropriate caching strategies

## File Organization
- Follow the monorepo structure: `apps/backend/`, `apps/frontend/`
- Tests mirror source structure in `tests/`
- Documentation in `docs/` with logical subfolders
- Infrastructure code in `infra/`

## Import Ordering
### Python
1. Standard library
2. Third-party packages
3. Local imports (absolute)
4. Local imports (relative)

### TypeScript/React
1. React/Next imports
2. Third-party packages
3. Local components
4. Local utilities
5. Styles
