# Cursor AI Rules for ResonaAI

This directory contains rules and guidelines for the Cursor AI assistant when working on the ResonaAI project.

## Rules Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `general.mdc` | Core coding principles, file organization, commit standards |
| `backend.mdc` | Python/FastAPI conventions, API design, microservice guidelines |
| `frontend.mdc` | React/TypeScript patterns, component structure, state management |
| `security.mdc` | Security requirements, data protection, compliance rules |

## How Rules Work

Cursor automatically loads these rules to provide context-aware assistance. The rules help ensure:

1. **Consistency** - All code follows the same patterns
2. **Security** - Healthcare-grade security practices
3. **Quality** - Production-ready code standards
4. **Compliance** - Kenya DPA and healthcare regulations

## Customizing Rules

Add new rule files for specific concerns:
- `testing.mdc` - Testing patterns and requirements
- `database.mdc` - Database schema and query guidelines
- `infrastructure.mdc` - DevOps and deployment rules

## Rule File Format

Use `.mdc` (Markdown Configuration) format with:
- Clear section headers
- Code examples where helpful
- Concise, actionable guidelines
