# ResonaAI Project Rules for Cursor AI

## Mandatory Documentation Workflow

### Rule 1: Planning Phase (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY WORK)

**BEFORE starting any implementation, feature development, or significant changes:**

1. **Create a Plan Document** in `ResonaAI/Plans/` folder
   - File naming: `YY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}.md` or `{phase}-{feature-name}.md`
   - Location: Place in appropriate phase folder:
     - `Plans/Phase1-Foundation/` - Frontend, Auth, Database
     - `Plans/Phase2-CoreInnovation/` - Dissonance Detector, Core features
     - `Plans/Phase3-Personalization/` - Baseline Tracker, Personalization
     - `Plans/Phase4-Microservices/` - Service implementations
     - `Plans/Phase5-AdvancedFeatures/` - Advanced features
     - `Plans/Phase6-Testing/` - Testing and QA
     - `Plans/Active/` - Currently active plans
   
2. **Plan Document Must Include:**
   - **Overview**: What will be implemented
   - **Objectives**: Clear goals and success criteria
   - **Scope**: What's included and excluded
   - **Implementation Steps**: Detailed task breakdown
   - **Dependencies**: What needs to be completed first
   - **Files to Create/Modify**: List of all affected files
   - **Testing Strategy**: How it will be tested
   - **Timeline**: Estimated duration
   - **Risks & Mitigation**: Potential issues and solutions

3. **Example Plan Structure:**
   ```markdown
   # Plan: [Feature Name]
   
   ## Overview
   [Description]
   
   ## Objectives
   - [ ] Objective 1
   - [ ] Objective 2
   
   ## Implementation Steps
   1. Step 1
   2. Step 2
   
   ## Files to Create/Modify
   - `path/to/file1.tsx`
   - `path/to/file2.py`
   
   ## Testing
   - Unit tests: [ ]
   - Integration tests: [ ]
   
   ## Timeline
   Estimated: X days/weeks
   ```

4. **Move to Active**: Once plan is created, move or reference it in `Plans/Active/` if it's the current work

### Rule 2: Progress Reporting Phase (REQUIRED AFTER COMPLETION)

**AFTER completing any implementation, feature, or significant change:**

1. **Create a Progress Report** in `ResonaAI/Progress Report/` folder
   - File naming: `YY-MM-DD-{feature-name}-Completion.md` or `{phase}-{feature-name}-Report.md`
   - Location: `ResonaAI/Progress Report/`
   
2. **Progress Report Must Include:**
   - **Completion Summary**: What was accomplished
   - **Files Created/Modified**: Complete list with line counts
   - **Implementation Details**: Technical details of what was built
   - **Testing Status**: What was tested and results
   - **Issues Encountered**: Problems faced and solutions
   - **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways
   - **Next Steps**: What needs to happen next
   - **Completion Date**: When work was finished
   - **Completion Percentage**: % complete (if partial)

3. **Example Progress Report Structure:**
   ```markdown
   # Progress Report: [Feature Name]
   
   **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Status**: Complete / In Progress / Blocked
   **Completion**: X%
   
   ## Summary
   [What was accomplished]
   
   ## Files Created
   - `path/to/file1.tsx` (X lines)
   - `path/to/file2.py` (Y lines)
   
   ## Files Modified
   - `path/to/file3.tsx` (changes made)
   
   ## Implementation Details
   [Technical details]
   
   ## Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests written
   - [ ] Integration tests written
   - [ ] Manual testing completed
   
   ## Issues & Solutions
   - Issue 1: [Description] → Solution: [How it was fixed]
   
   ## Lessons Learned
   - [Key takeaway 1]
   - [Key takeaway 2]
   
   ## Next Steps
   - [ ] Next action item 1
   - [ ] Next action item 2
   ```

### Rule 3: Workflow Enforcement

**For EVERY task, feature, or change:**

1. **START**: Create plan document first
   - ✅ Plan document exists in `Plans/` folder
   - ✅ Plan is reviewed and approved (if needed)
   - ✅ Plan is moved to `Plans/Active/` if starting work

2. **DURING**: Update plan document as needed
   - Update task checkboxes as work progresses
   - Note any scope changes
   - Document blockers or issues

3. **COMPLETE**: Create progress report
   - ✅ Progress report created in `Progress Report/` folder
   - ✅ All sections filled out
   - ✅ Plan moved to `Plans/Completed/` (if fully done)
   - ✅ Update main `Progress Report/README.md` if significant

### Rule 4: Plan Document Updates

**When updating plans:**

- Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
- Add notes for blockers with `⚠️ BLOCKED: [reason]`
- Update timeline if delays occur
- Document scope changes
- Keep plan document current

### Rule 5: Progress Report Standards

**Progress reports must be:**
- Honest about completion status
- Detailed about what was actually done
- Clear about what remains
- Actionable for next steps
- Linked to original plan document

### Rule 6: File Organization

**Plans Folder Structure:**
```
Plans/
├── Active/              # Currently being worked on
├── Completed/           # Finished plans
├── Phase1-Foundation/
├── Phase2-CoreInnovation/
├── Phase3-Personalization/
├── Phase4-Microservices/
├── Phase5-AdvancedFeatures/
└── Phase6-Testing/
```

**Progress Report Folder Structure:**
```
Progress Report/
├── README.md                    # Main index
├── Implementation-Details.md    # Technical deep dive
├── File-Manifest.md             # Complete file list
├── Next-Steps.md                # Roadmap
└── [feature]-Completion.md       # Individual reports
```

### Rule 7: Exceptions

**These changes DO NOT require full plan/report:**
- Minor bug fixes (< 10 lines changed)
- Documentation-only updates
- Configuration file adjustments
- Dependency updates
- Code formatting/refactoring (unless major)

**For exceptions, use simplified format:**
- Quick note in relevant plan document
- Or brief entry in `Progress Report/README.md`

### Rule 8: Plan Review Process

**Before starting implementation:**
1. Review existing plans in `Plans/Active/` to avoid duplication
2. Check `Plans/Completed/` for similar work
3. Verify dependencies are met
4. Confirm scope is clear
5. Get approval if required (for major features)

### Rule 9: Progress Report Integration

**After creating progress report:**
1. Update main `Progress Report/README.md` with summary
2. Update `Progress Report/File-Manifest.md` if new files created
3. Update `Progress Report/Implementation-Details.md` if technical details added
4. Update `Progress Report/Next-Steps.md` if roadmap changes
5. Link progress report to original plan document

### Rule 10: Quality Standards

**Plan documents must:**
- Be clear and actionable
- Include acceptance criteria
- List all dependencies
- Have realistic timelines
- Be reviewed before starting

**Progress reports must:**
- Accurately reflect what was done
- Include all created/modified files
- Document issues and solutions
- Provide clear next steps
- Be honest about completion status

## Enforcement

**Cursor AI must:**
1. ✅ ALWAYS create a plan document before starting work
2. ✅ ALWAYS create a progress report after completing work
3. ✅ NEVER skip documentation steps
4. ✅ ALWAYS update existing plans if scope changes
5. ✅ ALWAYS link progress reports to original plans

**When user requests work:**
1. First: Check if plan exists in `Plans/` folder
2. If no plan: Create plan document FIRST
3. Then: Proceed with implementation
4. After: Create progress report
5. Finally: Update main progress report index

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature Implementation
```
User: "Implement user profile editing"

AI Response:
1. Creates: Plans/Phase1-Foundation/User-Profile-Editing.md
2. Implements feature
3. Creates: Progress Report/User-Profile-Editing-Completion.md
4. Updates: Progress Report/README.md
```

### Example 2: Service Implementation
```
User: "Build the Cultural Context service"

AI Response:
1. Creates: Plans/Phase4-Microservices/Cultural-Context-Service.md
2. Moves to: Plans/Active/Cultural-Context-Service.md
3. Implements service
4. Creates: Progress Report/Cultural-Context-Service-Completion.md
5. Moves plan to: Plans/Completed/Cultural-Context-Service.md
```

## Reminders

- **No work without a plan** - Always create plan document first
- **No completion without a report** - Always create progress report after
- **Keep documentation current** - Update plans as work progresses
- **Link everything** - Connect plans to reports, reports to plans
- **Be thorough** - Detailed documentation helps future development
